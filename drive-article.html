				<p>Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) are technologies that provide a driver with essential information, automate difficult or repetitive tasks, and lead to an overall increase in car safety for everyone. Some of these technologies have been around for a long time, and they have already proven to result in an improved driving experience and better overall road safety. GPS navigation, for example, has become increasingly common in <a class="def-tool" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-original-title="See Help Center for a Definition" data-definition="<b>OEM</b> stands for Original Equiment Manufacturer which is basically a fancy term for a part of a car that the car company itslef does not make. Instead the piece is manufactured by an outside company.">OEM</a> infotainment systems since first being introduced in the 1990s.</p>
				<!-- <img src="imgs/traffic-blur.jpg" alt="" class="side-img"> -->
				<p>However, a lot of ADAS are right on the cutting edge of emerging automotive technologies. Some of these systems will have the staying power to stick around, and you can expect to see at least a few of them in your next car. Others may fizzle and disappear or be replaced by better implementations of the same basic idea. Since ADAS rely on electronics and often include firmware elements, the development of these cutting edge systems is governed by international safety standards like <a class="def-tool" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" data-original-title="See Help Center for a Definition" data-definition="<b>IEC-61508 and ISO-26262</b> are both international safety standards for electronics. IEC-61508 applies to all electronics and software, while ISO-26262 more specifically applies electronics and software in automobiles.">IEC-61508 and ISO-26262</a>.</p>
				<p>The following ADAS are all available in production models from a variety of OEMS:</p>

					<h4>Adaptive Cruise Control</h4>
					<p>This advanced driver assistance technology is especially useful on the highway, where drivers otherwise have to constantly monitor their cruise control systems for safety reasons. With advanced cruise control, a vehicle will automatically slow down or speed up in response to the actions of the car or truck in front of it. Most of these systems automatically shut off below a certain speed threshold, but others can even be used in stop and go traffic.</p> 
					<p>Adaptive cruise control is a system that is capable of automatically adjusting the speed of a vehicle to match the speed of the car or truck in front of it. If the lead vehicle slows down, adaptive cruise control can automatically match it. When traffic picks back up, these automatic systems are also capable of acceleration. Since adaptive cruise control is completely autonomous, these systems don’t require any input from the driver, other vehicles, or external infrastructure.</p>
					<h5>How Does Adaptive Cruise Control Work?</h5>
					<p>Cruise control is a relatively simple system that allows a driver to adjust the position of the throttle without using the gas pedal. It has been around for a very long time, and it often helps improve fuel economy at highway speeds. However, drivers who use cruise control have to remain constantly vigilant against the actions of other drivers. Most cruise control systems will shut off if the driver taps the brakes, but they aren’t capable of making automatic adjustments to the speed of a vehicle.</p>
					<p>Adaptive cruise control is similar in design to more traditional systems, but there are a few additional components in play. Instead of relying on driver input, adaptive cruise control systems make use of laser or radar sensors. These sensors are capable of detecting the presence and speed of other vehicles, and that information is used to maintain a safe following distance. If adaptive cruise control detects an obstruction in the roadway, or the lead vehicle slows down, the system is capable of cutting the throttle, downshifting, and even activating the brakes</p>
					<h5>What Vehicles Come with Adaptive Cruise Control?</h5>
					<p>The first vehicle with adaptive cruise control shipped in 1995, but the technology is still in its infancy. About a dozen automakers offer some type of adaptive cruise control, and most of the holdouts at least have something on the drawing board. However, the availability of fully adaptive cruise control is even more limited.</p>
					<p>BMW was one of the first automakers to offer fully adaptive cruise control, which is capable of bringing a vehicle to a complete stop. This option has been available on 7 series, 5 series, and 6 series BMWs since 2007. Mercedes, Volkswagen, GM, and a handful of others have also rolled out their own fully adaptive cruise control systems.</p>
					<p>In most cases, the adaptive cruise control option is limited to only a few models in each OEM lineup. A classic example is GM, which initially limited the option to its upmarket Cadillac badge. Starting with the 2014 model year, the Chevy Impala will also offer a fully adaptive system.</p>

						<h4>Lane Departure Warning Systems</h4>
						<p>Lane departure warning systems use a variety of sensors to make sure that a vehicle doesn’t leave its lane accidentally. If the system determines that the vehicle is drifting, it will sound an alarm so that the driver can take a corrective action in time to avoid hitting another car or running off the road. Lane keeping assistance systems go a step further and are actually capable of taking small corrective actions without any driver input.</p>
						<p>Lane departure warning systems are a group of safety technologies that that are primarily designed to prevent high speed accidents on highways and freeways. There are a few different types of lane departure warning systems, and some of them are more proactive than others. By warning the driver, or even taking automatic corrective actions, these systems are able to prevent many collisions and run-off-road accidents.</p>
						<h5>How Do Lane Departure Warning Systems Work?</h5>
						<p>There are two primary types of lane departure systems. The first type is typically referred to as a Lane Departure Warning (LDW) system. These systems monitor the lane markings on the roadway, which allows them to sound an alarm whenever a vehicle starts to deviate from its lane. The driver can then take corrective action, which can prevent a run-off-road accident or a collision with another vehicle.</p>
						<p>The other type of lane departure warning system is more proactive, so it is often referred to as a Lane-Keeping System (LKS), Lane-Keeping Assist, or other similar name. These systems also monitors lane markings, but they are capable of taking corrective action. If the driver doesn’t respond to an initial warning, a Lane-Keeping System can typically take action to keep the vehicle from drifting.</p>
						<p>Early lane departure warning systems used single video cameras to monitor lane markings, but modern systems that use visual information typically use video cameras.</p>
						<p>Other modern systems use laser or radar sensors instead.</p>
						<p>The methods that these systems use to provide corrective actions also differ from one situation to another. Some of the first lane-keeping systems made use of electronic stability control systems to keep a vehicle in its lane. This was accomplished by applying a slight braking pressure to the appropriate wheels. Modern systems are able to tap into power steering controls to actually provide a gentle steering correction.</p>
						<h5>What’s the Point of Lane Departure Warning Systems?</h5>
						<p>According to the National Highway Transportation Administration, about 70 percent of all single-vehicle highway fatalities in the United States occur in run-off-road accidents. Since run-off-the-road accidents occur when a vehicle leaves its lane and drives off the roadway, lane departure warning systems have the potential to help prevent many fatal accidents.</p>

Lane departure warning systems use a camera mounted on the back of the car to see the lane lines and alert you when you leave your lane.
