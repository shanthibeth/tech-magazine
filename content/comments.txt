i love the big slideshow, the images look great

the design and layout looks clean and crisp

the links at the bottom, maybe just put the name of the site and put an link tag to take you to the site?

the footer at the bottom seems really long

the touch screens article is linking to the wifi article

the car article is linking to the wifi article

-smart tech/everyday tech should also have navigation bar
-may want to set the picture of the articles to a tag as well as the title.

Leah: The site looks amazing! I love the help center on the side, the only thing missing is a way to contact you and info in the footer part, and if you would like you can change the Related Links on the bottom based on the page your one

Jessica: I really like how you put it all together. The color theme is great too Maybe just make the logo a little bit bigger its a little difficult to see. At first I thought the background of your logo was black but i see that it isn't . Its easier to see it with the white background. Over all it is well constructed.

-very clean and simple websiteâ€¦which is a good thing. i like how everything is organized. 
-footer for articles are a bit to big long, i would recommend shortening the height of it. 
-i also like how the logo is interactive

i love your site, very clean and crisp, but i think i already said that yesterday
i also love the help center idea
i don't have too much criticism here, sorry!
the pictures at the start of each article, maybe try shifting them more to the right so that the starting is in line with the starting of the text?

I like the color scheme a lot, with all the white space it goes well together
The fixed help center section is great
The banner images on the home page are also great, I love that they slide
maybe line up the text so that it lines up with the image (file:///Volumes/USB20FD/WebDesign/magazine-root/drive-article.html)
your logo looks really interesting, how about making it bigger? Or maybe you can include that in the footer section so people can really see what it looks like
The title links on the home page are blue, maybe change it to green or purple so that it matches the other colors
the text size and line height make the text very easy to read, I like your font choices
